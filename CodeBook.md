The run_analysis.R script performs the following to clean up the data:

Merges the training and test sets to create one data set.

Reads features.txt and extracts measurements on the mean and standard deviation.

Reads activity_labels.txt and adds descriptive activity names.

Labels the data set with descriptive names.

The script also creates an independent tidy data set with the average measurement for each activity and each subject.
